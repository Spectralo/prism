# Pr!sm 3D Printer!

What is Pr!sm ? \
The end goal is to have a little printer similar to the a1 mini but open source, cool looking and running klipper !

## The plan

### Wanted specifications 
_Time : 0.5 hours_

These might change, i don't know if they're realizable :/

- 180x180x180 mm build space (like the a1 mini)
- Running klipper
- All 3d printed parts should fit on the a1 mini bed / pr!sm bed
- Cool transparent PETG (It's called pr!sm after all)
- Doesn't start on fire (that may be repeated on all printers, but that's still useful)
- PLA/PETG/TPU printing as the a1 mini, we don't need something fancy

## Progress

### Bom
_Time : 0.5 hours_

Work in Progress
